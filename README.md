# Analyzing-Customer-Churn
For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this **Power** BI case study, I investigated a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyzed their churn rates.
To accomplish this, I followed several steps. In the data preparation phase, I conducted a **data** **check**, inspecting missing values, outliers, and unique IDs to ensure data quality. For **data** **analysis**, I utilized **DAX** to calculate churn rates and investigated various hypotheses: whether discounted rates attract more customers, the impact of unlimited data plans on churn, the influence of international plans on loyalty, and how to improve customer service.
For **visualizations**, I created several dashboards: a general churn overview, a demographic analysis by age group, payment method, and contract, the impact of additional charges on churn, and a section with key findings and recommendations.
Among the key findings, it emerged that California has the highest churn rate but a low number of customer service calls, and that a high number of customer service calls correlates with higher churn rates.
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the ability to transform raw data into strategic insights, guiding better decision-making. Power BI training at Data Camp significantly enhanced these analytical skills.
